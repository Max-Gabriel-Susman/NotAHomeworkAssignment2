A Fluky Number is a number that is equal to the sum of a set of random numbers, where the random numbers are the
first random numbers generated after seeding a random number generator with each factor of the number, not including
itself. That's quite a mouthful, so here it is again in simpler terms. All of the following requirements must be met
for a number to be a Fluky Number.

A Fluky Number is a number, called The Number,  that is equal to the sum of a set of randomly generated numbers.

Random numbers are generated with a random number function. We will use randint() from the random module.

The randomly generated numbers are in the range of 1 to the The Number, inclusive. (Ex. If The Number is 10, the
random number can be 1 through 10, including 1 and 10)

Random numbers are the first number generated after setting a specific seed value (Use the random.seed() function).

The seed values are all of the factors of The Number, not including itself. (Ex. The factors of the number 10 that
will be used for the seed are 1, 2, and 5)
