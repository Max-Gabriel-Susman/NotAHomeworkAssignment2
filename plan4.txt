Requirements Specification
    The program will run a simulation 100,000 times just to make a complete laughing stock of that armchair statistican.
    A sample will be collected from each simulation and added to a test pool of data that statistical analysis will be performed
    against. After the tests are completed the results are logged to the console. If the user can't believe their own eyes they are
    welcome to queue up another round of tests with a simple "yes", once they're are satisfied with procedural annihilation of this
    pitiful zookeepers hopes and dreams they are welcome to opt out of additional testing by being assertive and saying "no".

System Analysis

    The system's activities primarily occur within a top-level while loop and it's child while loop. The iterations of
    the top-level while loop represent
    the variables elephantAPen, elephantBPen and penChecked all store a pseudo randomly generated integer from a range
    of one to six.
