Requirements Specification
    Let the user guess a number between 1 and 10, their guess will be compared against a pseudo randomly generated
    integer between 1 and 10. The proximity of their guess and the generated value will determine one of 4
    progressively demeaning responses that will be rendered in the console.

System Analysis

        guessNum = the number between 1 and 10 submitted by the user
        pickNum = the number between 1 and 10 generated by external code

        1 <= guessNum, pickNum <= 10

        msg = the string response rendered in the console

        d, e, f, & g are the set of values msg may possess

        where guessNum and pickNum are equivalent : msg = d
        where guessNum and pickNum +/- 1 are equivalent : msg = e
        where guessNum and pickNum +/- 2 are equivalent : msg = f
        where guessNum and pickNum +/- 3 or more are equivalent : msg = g

System Design
    import the random module
    generate a randome integer between 1 and 10 and assign the value to guessNum variable
    prompt user to input an integer value between one and 10 and store value in pickNum variable
    create a sting variable named msg to store the programs response to the users input
    assign one of four string values to the msg variable based on proximity of guessNum and pickNum
    display msg variables value to console

Implementation - solitary *.py file

Testing
    Nine test cases
    Test 1
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 5
        msg is "Honored to play with you, Master."
    Test 2
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 4
        msg is "You are a worthy opponent, Knight."
    Test 3
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 6
        msg is "You are a worthy opponent, Knight."
    Test 4
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 3
        msg is "You have much to learn, Padawan."
    Test 5
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 7
        msg is "You have much to learn, Padawan."
    Test 6
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 2
        msg is "Youngling, your time will come."
    Test 7
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 8
        msg is "Youngling, your time will come."
    Test 8
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 1
        msg is "Honored to play with you, Master."
    Test 9
        guessNum is 5
        pickNum is 9
        msg is "Keep working hard in the Service Corps."
