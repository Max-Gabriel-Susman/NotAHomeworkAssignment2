Requirements Specification
    Let the user enter the name, position, and personal space radius for persons 1 and 2. The program will use the
    data submitted for persons 1 and 2 to perform the Person test and the Space test. The Person test being used to
    detemine which person's personal space is being violated if any. The space test shall determine if the personal
    spaces of persons 1 and 2 overlap.

System Analysis
    personTest;
    spaceTest;

    nameOne, is the name of person one
    xOne, is the x coordinate of person one
    yOne, is the y coordinate of person one
    radiusOne, is the radius of person one

    nameTwo, is the name of person two
    xTwo, is the x coordinate of person two
    yTwo, is the y coordinate of person two
    radiusTwo, is the radius of person two

    personProximity, is the distance between the positions of persons one and two
    personProximity = (((xTwo - xOne)^2)+((yTwo - yOne)^2))^-2

    The values of the personTest and spaceTest tests shall be determined by the relation of the personProximity,
    radiusOne, and radiusTwo

    personTest shall observe one of four relations between the aforementioned values and be assigned a distinct
    value accordingly:
        Person One is in Person Two's personal space                        :   radiusOne < personProximity && radiusTwo > personProximity
        Person Two is in Person One's personal space                        :   radiusOne > personProximity && radiusTwo < personProximity
        Person One and Person Two are in each other's personal space        :   radiusOne > personProximity && radiusTwo > personProximity
        Neither Person One nor Person Two is in the other's personal space  :   radiusOne < personProximity && radiusTwo < personProximity

    spaceTest shall observe one of four relations between the aforementioned values and be assigned a distinct
    value accordingly:
        Person One and Person Two's personal spaces overlap                         :   radiusOne + radiusTwo >= personProximity
        Person One and Person Two's personal spaces do not overlap                  :   radiusOne + radiusTwo < personProximity
        Person One's personal space is entirely inside Person Two's personal space  :   radiusTwo >= personProximity + radiusOne
        Person Two's personal space is entirely inside Person One's personal space  :   radiusOne >= personProximity + radiusTwo

System Design
    Welcome message rendered in console
    Person one heading rendered in console
    User is prompted for entry of person one's name, position, and personal space radius
    Person two heading rendered in console
    User is prompted for entry of person two's name, position, and personal space radius
    the personProximity is assigned the value of the distance between two points formula
    performed against the persons' positions.
    At this point the person and space tests are performed against the values of personProximity,
    radiusOne, and radiusTwo, and the results of the tests determines the string values assigned to
    the personTest and spaceTest variables.
    Now, you were probably expecting this but the Social Situation Analysis gets rendered in console and then
    the string values that were assigned to the personTest and spaceTest variables get rendered
    in console.

Implementation - code 'n stuff

Testing
    how many tests eh?
